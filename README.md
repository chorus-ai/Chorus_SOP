## How to contribute

To add or update the guidelines, you will need to edit the relevant markdown files. The easiest way to do this is to find the relevant file on GitHub, click "edit", and then follow the steps to create a "pull request". You can navigate to the relevant markdown file on GitHub from the website by clicking the `Edit this page` button at the bottom. Alternatively, if you are familiar with git, you can submit a pull request in the usual way.

Once a pull request is opened it will be reviewed by CHoRUS colleagues. After the pull is request is approved, you may merge it into the repository by clicking "Merge". Merging a pull request will trigger a rebuild of the website.

If you would like to add topics that are not yet represented, please add your request to [`issues`](https://github.com/chorus-ai/Chorus_SOP/issues).
