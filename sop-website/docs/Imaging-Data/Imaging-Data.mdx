**Purpose**

This document is for data contributing sites to better understand CHoRUS obligations with respect to Imaging Data

## **Imaging data**


### Data Processing Steps

1. Identify data extraction partners and methods (e.g., CTSI)
2. Identify the sources of the data (e.g., PACS, site research repository)
3. Determine which image modalities would need to be extracted, date range, and size
4. Confirm the type of data format you will receive (e.g., DICOM)
5. Confirm the type of IDs used to link this data to the patient (e.g., name) or other hospital ID (e.g., MRN)
6. Map local relevant metadata with CHORUS metadata using OMOP format
7. Identify metadata not covered by CHORUS that would be relevant
8. Data deidentification and cross-walk to PHI
9. Data quality review (e.g., data missingness)
10. Upload imaging data to the CHoRUS cloud
11. Upload all data tables and metadata files to your site-specific cloud enclave within the CHoRUS cloud environment.

### Imaging Metadata OMOP CDM

Files will be organized hierarchically by patient, modality, study\_UID, and, series\_UID.

- Data Summary by Modality**

We are asking for a summary of radiology occurrence count and radiology image count by imaging modality (e.g., CT, MR). Within those groups, we would like to have a breakdown of manufacturers and body part imaged (e.g., brain, chest).

**Table X. Radiology Occurrence**

|Field|Required|Data type|Description||
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
|image\_occurrence\_id (PK)|Yes|integer |The unique key is given to an imaging study record (often referred to as the accession number or imaging order number)  ||
|person\_id (FK)|Yes|integer|The person\_id of the Person for whom the procedure is recorded. This may be a system-generated code.||
|procedure\_occurrence\_id (FK)|Yes|integer |The unique key is given to a procedure record for a person. Link to the Procedure\_occurrence table.||
|visit\_occurrence\_id (FK)|No|integer|The unique key is given to the visit record for a person. Link to the Visit\_occurrence table.||
|anatomic\_site\_concept\_id (FK)|No|integer|Anatomical location of the imaging procedure by the medical acquisition device (gross anatomy). It maps the ANATOMIC\_SITE\_SOURCE\_VALUE to a Standard Concept in the Spec Anatomic Site domain. This should be coded at the lowest level of granularity.||
|wadors\_uri |No |varchar (max) |A Web Access to DICOM Objects via Restful Web Services Uniform Resource Identifier on study level.||
|local\_path|Yes|varchar (max)|Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path to the folder containing the image object file access via a storage block access protocol. (e.g., \\Server\Directory)||
|image\_occurrence\_date |Yes|date |The date the imaging procedure occurred. ||
|image\_study\_UID |Yes|varchar (250) |DICOM Study UID ||
|image\_series\_UID |Yes |varchar (250) |DICOM Series UID||
|modality |Yes |varchar (250) |DICOM-defined value (e.g., US, CT, MR, PT, DR, CR, NM)||

**Table X. Radiology Image**

|Field|Required|Data type|Description|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|image\_feature\_id (PK)|Yes |integer |The unique key is given to an imaging feature. |
|person\_id (FK)|Yes |integer|<p>The person\_id of the Person table for whom the </p><p>the procedure is recorded. This may be a system-generated code.</p>|
|image\_occurrence\_id (FK)|Yes|integer|The unique key of the Image\_occurrence table.|
|table\_concept\_id|Yes|integer|The concept\_id of the domain table that feature is stored in Measurement, Observation, etc. This concept should be used with the table\_row\_id.|
|table\_row\_id|Yes|integer|The row\_id of the domain table that feature is stored.|
|image\_feature\_concept\_id|Yes|integer|Concept\_id of standard vocabularyâ€”often a LOINC or RadLex of image features|
|image\_feature\_type\_concept\_id|Yes|integer |<p>This field can be used to determine the provenance of the imaging features (e.g., DICOM SR, algorithms used on </p><p>images)</p>|
|image\_finding\_concept\_id|No|integer|<p>RadLex or other terms of the groupings of image </p><p>feature (e.g., nodule)</p>|
|image\_finding\_num|No|integer |Integer for linking related image features. It should not be interpreted as an order of clinical relevance.|
|anatomic\_site\_concept\_id|No|integer |This is the site on the body where the feature was found. It maps the ANATOMIC\_SITE\_SOURCE\_VALUE to a Standard Concept in the Spec Anatomic Site domain.|
|alg\_system |No |<p>varchar </p><p>(max) </p>|<p>URI of the algorithm that extracted features, </p><p>including version information</p>|
|alg\_datetime |No |datetime |The date and time of the algorithm processing.|
