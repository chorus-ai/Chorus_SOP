# Purpose

Guidance for Data Acquisition Sites regarding imaging data processing, harmonization, and upload

# Procedures

> Data Preparation
1. Identify data extraction partners and methods (e.g., CTSI) 

2. Identify the sources of the data (e.g., PACS, site research repository) 

3. Determine which image modalities would need to be extracted, date range, and size 

4. Confirm the type of data format you will receive (e.g., DICOM; DICOM is the target format for CHORUS) 

5. Confirm the type of IDs used to link this data to the patient (e.g., name) or other hospital ID (e.g., MRN) => refer to Standards SOP on data linkage

6. Identify accession numbers for specific image tests. Preferred method is using EHR search to filter tests based on encounter (e.g., CDW) and not pulling directly from PACS based on patient identifier. This is to simplify image test mapping to the primary encounter of interest for the multimoda ldata pull.

7. Map header metadata reevant ot your local site with header metadata selected by CHORUS using OMOP format (list of metadata fields and OMOP mapping in Table 1 below).

8. Identify metadata not covered by CHORUS that would be relevant to your site locally.

9. Pursue local data quality review (e.g., data missingness). 

> DICOM Metadata de-identification

9. Identifiable cross walk table creation: maps all original DICOM metadatafields to the deidentification procedure (e.g., replacement, erase, etc) and the new field in the deidentified DICOM, so this can be used as a crosswalk (crosswalk table stays local at site and is not shared)

10. Deidentified DICOM metadata table (for sharing): to enable imaging data querying without loading DICOM data

11. Use CHORUS deidentification tool: 

- CTP set up instructions

12. DICOM deidentification (for sharing): deidentified DICOM files

13. Test deidentified DICOM readability: load file in Horos/Osirix to ensure that DICOM can open
