# Awaiting Approval

## 1. Purpose

This SOP provides comprehensive guidelines for CHoRUS consortium sites to execute the second data request, including patient selection criteria, required data elements, timeline specifications, and upload procedures.

## 3. Definitions

- **Index Admission**: The primary hospitalization that qualifies a patient for inclusion in the CHoRUS dataset, serving as the anchor point for data collection.
- **Lookback Period**: The 365-day period prior to index admission used for collecting relevant clinical history and baseline data.
- **Follow-up Period**: The post-discharge observation period for capturing outcomes and care transitions.
- **Data Request Window**: The specific timeframe during which sites must complete data extraction and upload activities.
- **Patient Cohort**: The defined population meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria for the second data request.
- **Data Elements**: Specific clinical variables, measurements, and observations required for extraction from participating sites.
- **Upload Timeline**: The structured schedule for data submission phases and quality control checkpoints.
