id: Waveform File Format
description:  An SOP for the waveform file format
---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the standard waveform file format for data contributions to the CHoRUS project. The purpose is to ensure consistent formatting of clinical waveform data submitted by participating hospitals. For a high level summary of the process for contributing waveform data to CHoRUS, see the SOP on [contributing waveforms](/Chorus_SOP/docs/Waveform-Data/).

---

## 2. File Structure

All waveform data must adhere to the following directory structure to facilitate ingestion and processing.

### 2.1. Example File Structure

```plaintext
.
├── <person_id>                            # Patient-specific subdirectory
│   └── waveforms
│       └── <session_number>
│           ├── <session_number>.hea       # Header file for waveform record <session_number>
│           └── <session_number>.dat       # Signal file (second segment)
└── RECORDS                                # List of all record names (one per line)
```

### 2.2. Explanation of File Structure

- `<person_id>/`:
  - Root directory for all patient data. Each patient should have a unique identifier (e.g., `10001`).
- `waveforms/`:
  - Patients may have multiple types of data. The `waveforms` folder is intended for grouping waveforms.
  - Inside each patient directory, files are organized by `<session_number>`.
- `<session_number>/`:
  - Session number indicates a unique recording for the patient. A single patient (i.e. a single `<person_id>`) may contain multiple sessions.

Submissions in WFDB format:
- Record files:
  - Each record consists of one or more:
    - `.hea` file/s: Metadata and configuration of the waveform record.
    - `.dat` file/s: Binary signal files, one or more per record.

Submissions not in WFDB format:
- Should follow the naming structure outlined above but stored in the format being provided (e.g. hdf5)

## 3. Header File (.hea) Format

The WFDB `.hea` file is a text file containing metadata about the waveform record. It must follow the WFDB standard header format. Below is an example:

### 3.1. Example Header File: `12345.hea`

```
12345 2 360 650000
12345.dat 16 200/μV 8 0 0 1234 0 ECG1
12345.dat 16 200/μV 8 0 0 1234 0 ECG2
# Age: 65
# Sex: Male
# Diagnosis: Myocardial Infarction
```

### 3.2. Explanation of Header Content

1. First Line (General Record Info):
    - `12345`: Record name (must match the filename prefix).
    - `2`: Number of signals in the record.
    - `360`: Sampling frequency in Hz.
    - `650000`: Number of samples per signal.

2. Subsequent Lines (Signal Descriptions):
    - `12345x.dat`: Filename of the signal file.
    - `16`: Storage format (16-bit integers).
    - `200/μV`: ADC gain (e.g., 200 digital units per microvolt).
    - `8`: ADC resolution (bits).
    - `0`: ADC zero value.
    - `0`: Initial value.
    - `1234`: Checksum (sum of all samples modulo 2^16).
    - `0`: Block size.
    - `ECG1`: Signal label (e.g., lead name).

3. Comments (Optional):
    - Lines starting with `#` contain additional metadata, such as patient demographics and clinical information.
    - We discourage use of comments. Instead, metadata should be captured in the associated structured EHR data contribution.

## 4. Tools and Resources

- WFDB Conversion Tools:
  - [WFDB python](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/wfdb-python): WFDB Python package.

## 5. Preparing Waveforms
The WFDB python toolbox will handle writing the `.hea` and `.dat` files once the required information is provided. 

### 5.1. WFDB formatted submissions

### 5.1.1. Segment Definition
In WFDB, a segment is a continous set of signals. Each segment has a `.hea` file and at least one `.dat` file.

### 5.1.2. Time Shifting
If your EHR, waveform, and imaging data are being date shifted, all data for a given subject must be shifted by the same amount
of time. See [Multimodal-Linkage](https://chorus-ai.github.io/Chorus_SOP/docs/Multimodal-Linkage/) for more detail.

### 5.1.3. High Frequency Waveforms
High frequency waveform files (e.g. ECG, EEG) should be saved by writing a WFDB record. A single segment record can be written
with `wfdb.io.wrsamp`. A multisegment record should be written by creating a `wfdb.io.MultiRecord` and using its `wrsamp` 
method to save the WFDB file. 

A new segment should be create if either of these conditions are met:
- The length of the current segment exceeds 8 hours
- The set of channels in the data changes. In other words if a channel's data stream disappears or a new channel appears. If 
a channel's data has disappeared for more than 5 minutes a new segment should be created. However, if it disappears for less
than 5 minutes, the missing data should be filled with NaNs, and a new segment should not be created. 

### 5.2. Low Frequency Vitals / Numerics
Low frequency signals (e.g. heart rate) should be saved as a CSV file in the same folder as the high frequency waveforms.
The CSV file should be named as `<session_number>n.csv`. Please do not resample the low frequency signals in an effort to 
create a uniform time interval. 

### 5.3. Non-WFDB formatted submissions
As mentioned in [contributing waveforms](/Chorus_SOP/docs/Waveform-Data/), detailed information about submissions not in
WFDB format need to be provided. This should include the following information in addition to any other relevant information:
- Explanation for each variable in the submission (e.g. `StartTime` is the time at the start of the first sample in the
stream)
- The data type for each variable
- Units for each variable (as applicable)
- How the data is encoded
- Information about how to calculate the sample interval (e.g. `EndTime` - `StartTime` / `# samples`)
- Indication about whether the sample intervals are uniform for each waveform type and channel.
